ScalaFX example with http4s client talking to a json endpoint along with Circe

Run it up via ```sbt run```

If you select a row on the table, it will show on stdout

If you click the fetch quotes button it will call the Json endpoint and pull it back to the table

## Note

You'll need a JDK that supports JavaFX, or include it yourself https://github.com/scalafx/scalafx#scalafx-dependencies

So if it complains, you know what to do
